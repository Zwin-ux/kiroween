# Haunted Debug Game - Aesthetic System Documentation

## Overview

The Haunted Debug Game implements a unified "haunted-industrial programming world" aesthetic that transforms debugging into an atmospheric, educational experience. This system combines cartoon-industrial fantasy visuals with warm metals, ghostly terminals, and dynamic atmospheric effects.

## Design Philosophy
